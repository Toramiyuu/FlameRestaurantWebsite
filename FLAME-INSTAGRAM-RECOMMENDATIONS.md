## CRITICAL ACTIONS

### 1. Update Bio Link (Do This First!)
**Current:** flamerestaurant.geniuspos-booking.com.my
**Change to:** flamerestaurant.my (your new website)

Your bio should read:
```
Best Steak with Best View in Penang
Aged Steak | Tomahawk | Dessert
12-3pm, 6-11pm | Closed Wed
📍 De View Hotel Rooftop, Ayer Itam
⬇️ Reserve Now
[flamerestaurant.my]
```

---

### 2. Rename Story Highlights
Current highlights use single emojis which don't tell visitors anything.

**Rename to:**
| Current | Change To |
|---------|-----------|
| 🍖 | MENU |
| 📷2024 | REVIEWS |
| 👍 | STEAKS |
| 🥩 | WAGYU |
| 🏕️ | DOME |
| Fire show | FIRE SHOW |
| ⭐ | THE VIEW |

---

### 3. Reduce "Full House" Posts
You're posting "Full House" updates too frequently (3-4x per week).

**Recommendation:**
- Maximum 1 "Full House" post per week
- Vary the design/angle each time
- Add more context (what dishes sold out, special occasions)

---

### 4. Clean Up Following List
**Current:** Following 3,671 accounts (65% of your follower count)
**Issue:** This suggests follow-for-follow tactics

**Action:**
- Unfollow inactive/irrelevant accounts
- Aim for following ratio under 1,000
- Only follow relevant accounts (suppliers, partners, food media)

---

## CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS

### 5. Create Content Pillars
Post consistently using these themes:

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| Mon | Menu Monday | Highlight one dish with price |
| Wed | Closed (BTS prep) | Kitchen prep, staff moments |
| Fri | Full House Friday | Only one per week |
| Sat | The View | Sunset/night views |
| Sun | Customer Stories | Repost customer content |

### 6. Standardize Photography
**Problem:** Mix of professional and phone-quality photos

**Solution:**
- Use same editing preset for all photos
- Dark, moody aesthetic (matches your brand)
- Avoid bright promotional graphics mixing with food photos
- If using Canva templates, stick to ONE design style

### 7. Add Pricing to Food Posts
Every food post should include:
- Dish name
- Brief description
- Price (RM XX)
- "Book via link in bio"

---

## ENGAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS

### 8. Increase Comments
**Current:** Low comment-to-like ratio (208 likes, 2 comments)

**Actions:**
- End captions with questions ("What's your favorite cut?")
- Reply to EVERY comment within 1 hour
- Use Instagram's question sticker in Stories
- Create polls about menu items

### 9. Hashtag Strategy
Use these hashtags consistently (mix of sizes):

**High reach:**
#penangfood #penangfoodie #malaysianfood #steaklover

**Medium reach:**
#penangrestaurant #ayeritam #steakpenang #rooftopdining

**Niche/branded:**
#flamerestaurant #flamepenang #deviewhotel #kekloksiview
